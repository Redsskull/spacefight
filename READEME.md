# SpaceFight

A 2D action game built with Pygame where players defend their spaceship from an alien bug invasion.

## About
SpaceFight is a work-in-progress game that follows the crew of the mining vessel 'Hyperion' as they face off against hostile alien bugs. Players can select from multiple characters, each with unique abilities and stats.

## About the Art & Graphics

Hey there! I'm currently handling all the art myself using Pygame's basic shapes and rectangles. While I'm learning a lot about game development, I'll be honest - I'm not an artist! Right now, the game's visuals are pretty basic:

- Characters are rendered as colored rectangles (yeah, really!)
- Cutscenes are drawn using basic geometric shapes
- UI is minimal with simple text and boxes
- Animations are... well, let's say "work in progress"

### Calling All Artists! 

If you're an artist who loves space games and wants to help transform colored rectangles into awesome character sprites and stunning space environments, I'd love to hear from you! I have tons of ideas but limited artistic skills. Whether you can help with:

- Character designs
- Enemy sprites
- Background art
- UI elements
- Cutscene illustrations
- Simple animations

...or just want to give feedback on the visual direction, please reach out! This is a passion project that I'm building to learn game dev, and I'd be thrilled to collaborate with fellow creators.

Even if you're just starting out with pixel art or game art, let's chat! We can learn and grow together. ðŸš€
