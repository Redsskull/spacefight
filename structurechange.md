characters.py: Contains character definitions but no direct drawing or updating logic.

story_screen.py: No longer handles text, sound, and effects directly. Instead, it calls methods from the managers.

managers/character_manager.py: Handles character-related tasks like drawing and updating positions.

managers/sound_manager.py: Loads and plays sound/music.

managers/screen_effects.py: Manages visual effects like screen shaking.

story.json: Stores all the story segments, dialogue, and other story-related text.


## implamentation

## Day 1-2: Move Story Text to JSON
### Objective: 
Separate story text and dialogue from the game code to keep things modular and easy to maintain.

### Steps:
1. **Create `story.json`**:
   - In the `/assets` folder, create a new JSON file (e.g., `story.json`).
   - Copy the story text from `story_screen.py` and organize it into segments in the JSON format. Each segment will have a `text` field and, optionally, a `speaker`.

2. **Modify `story_screen.py`**:
   - Replace the hardcoded story text with logic that reads from `story.json`.
   - Ensure you load the JSON file and parse it at the start of `story_screen.py`.

### Outcome:
The story will be loaded from `story.json`, separating data from logic.

## Day 3-4: Introduce Character Manager
### Objective: 
Move character-related tasks (initialization, drawing, movement) into a `CharacterManager`, keeping `story_screen.py` clean.

### Steps:
1. **Create `CharacterManager`**:
   - In the `/managers` folder, create a new `character_manager.py` file.
   - Move the character initialization and drawing logic from `story_screen.py` into this file.

2. **Refactor `characters.py`**:
   - Ensure `characters.py` only contains character definitions, with all interaction happening through the `CharacterManager`.

3. **Update `story_screen.py`**:
   - Replace direct character references with calls to `CharacterManager`.

### Outcome:
Character handling is centralized, making `story_screen.py` easier to manage.

---

## Day 5-6: Introduce Sound Manager
### Objective: 
Manage all sound effects and background music in a separate `SoundManager` to avoid cluttering `story_screen.py`.

### Steps:
1. **Create `SoundManager`**:
   - In the `/managers` folder, create a `sound_manager.py` file.
   - Move all sound initialization and playback logic from `story_screen.py` into this file.

2. **Update `story_screen.py`**:
   - Remove any sound-related code and replace it with calls to `SoundManager`.

### Outcome:
All sounds will be managed by the `SoundManager`, keeping audio logic separate from the rest of the game.

---

## Day 7-8: Introduce Screen Effects Manager
### Objective: 
Centralize screen effects (such as shaking) into a `ScreenEffectsManager` for better organization.

### Steps:
1. **Create `ScreenEffectsManager`**:
   - In the `/managers` folder, create a `screen_effects.py` file.
   - Move the screen shake and other effects logic from `story_screen.py` into this file.

2. **Update `story_screen.py`**:
   - Replace direct effect logic with calls to `ScreenEffectsManager`.

### Outcome:
All visual effects will be managed independently, reducing complexity in `story_screen.py`.

---

## Day 9: Testing and Debugging
### Objective: 
Test the refactored project thoroughly to ensure everything still works as expected.

### Steps:
1. **Run the Game**:
   - Make sure the game still runs without issues.
   - Test each screen, character interaction, sound effect, and visual effect.

2. **Fix Bugs**:
   - If anything breaks during testing, troubleshoot and fix the issues.

### Outcome:
By the end of the day, the game should be running smoothly with the new structure in place.

---

## Day 10: Review and Future Improvements
### Objective: 
Reflect on the refactor and identify any areas for future improvement.

### Steps:
1. **Review Code**:
   - Check if the code is easier to read and maintain.
   - Note any areas that could be further improved or optimized in the future.

2. **Consider Future Features**:
   - Think about what features you might add next (e.g., additional screens, new characters, more effects) and how the current structure can accommodate them.

---

## Conclusion
By breaking down the refactor into small, manageable steps, you can make the necessary changes to improve the structure of your game without feeling overwhelmed. Take it one day at a time, and don't hesitate to review your progress regularly.

Good luck!
