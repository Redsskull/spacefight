## level screen todos

- [ ] Characters need to be initilized differently than the story screen. I need to change that in the manager.
- [ ] I need a combat indicator, perhaps make the characters higher rectangles.
- [ ] The characters are moving above the surface. I need to somehow make sure the game knows where the surface is.
